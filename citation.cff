  The evaluation of English text embeddings has transitioned
  from evaluating a handful of datasets to broad coverage
  across many tasks through benchmarks such as MTEB.
  However, this is not the case for multilingual text
  embeddings due to a lack of available benchmarks. To
  address this problem, we introduce the Scandinavian
  Embedding Benchmark (SEB). SEB is a comprehensive
  framework that enables text embedding evaluation for
  Scandinavian languages across 24 tasks, 10 subtasks, and 4
  task categories. Building on SEB, we evaluate more than 26
  models, uncovering significant performance disparities
  between public and commercial solutions not previously
  captured by MTEB. We open-source SEB and integrate it with
  MTEB, thus bridging the text embedding evaluation gap for
  Scandinavian languages.
